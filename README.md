# wasm-dd2 — Destruction Derby 2 (dd2h.exe) → WebAssembly

A faithful port of the 1996 game **Destruction Derby 2** (`dd2h.exe`, 640x480 build) to reproducible C
compiling to native and WebAssembly. The engine C is **mechanically derived from the binary via Ghidra**
(decompile → transpile/patch → compile); only the platform/runtime shim (DirectDraw→canvas,
DirectSound→WebAudio, Win32/CRT) is hand-written.

Pipeline: `dd2h.exe → tools/decompile.sh → tools/transpile.py → tools/build*.sh`.
See **CLAUDE.md** for build commands, current status, and conventions.

Place the original game files (`dd2h.exe` and `Dirinfo`) in `DestructionDerby2/`, then
run `make image`, `make native`, `make wasm`, and `make web`. `make shot` captures the
browser build. Game files and generated builds are ignored by Git.
The ISO release packages the game in InstallShield 3's `DATA.Z`; it can be unpacked
with [unshieldv3](https://github.com/wfr/unshieldv3).

Alternatively, run `make provision`. It downloads the provided Windows BIN/CUE ZIP,
verifies its SHA-256, builds a pinned unshieldv3 extractor with Git/CMake/GCC, and
installs the game and memory image in `DestructionDerby2/`. It also extracts all 18
CD audio tracks byte-for-byte into `DestructionDerby2/Redbook/` with a disc manifest.
Existing `SaveGames` is preserved. Downloads, original files and audio are ignored
by Git. An existing ZIP can be used with
`python3 tools/provision_game.py --archive /path/to/Destruction-Derby-2_Win_EN_ISO-Version.zip`;
`--url` accepts a refreshed download link to the same verified archive.

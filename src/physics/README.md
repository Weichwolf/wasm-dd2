# Physics

Own vehicle motion, collision and damage with an explicit simulation step.
Keep rendering and operating-system calls out of this module. Verify stable
behavior on native and WASM, including fast-math edge cases.

`road_contact.c` provides vertical contact with one known road/arena lane cell.
It selects an active triangle in XZ, includes shared edges, rejects missing or
zero-area triangles and returns its interpolated height and unit normal with
positive Y. Calculations use double precision and convert source coordinates
before subtracting, avoiding signed integer overflow at coordinate extremes.
Queries must be finite. Edge tolerance is 1e-6 in world coordinates, converted
to each edge's barycentric scale; it cannot grow with the cell size. Points
beyond this numerical tolerance fail. Signed-coordinate extremes and a point
one unit outside an extremely large cell are checked on both targets.

Synthetic CTests run on native and WASM. `make rewrite-road-verify` checks the
original contact geometry against independent plane calculations with ASan/UBSan
as well. Source contact normals are not used, and original fixed-point height
rounding is not a rewrite requirement. Surface search, wheel suspension,
drivetrain, steering, jumps, collisions and damage remain to be implemented.

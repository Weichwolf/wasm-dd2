# Destruction Derby 2 → WASM

## Goal
A fully playable 1:1 rebuild of the original **`dd2h.exe`** (Destruction Derby 2, 640x480) with
**bit-identical audio and video output**: given the same input and RNG state, the rebuild produces the
same framebuffer every frame and the same audio stream as the original on Windows — menus, track
select, race, and demo mode fully usable via keyboard/pad, native and in the browser (WASM). The route
there is a reproducible chain that always starts with `make` (`make decompile → make patch → make
native / make wasm`), so the whole pipeline binary → decompile → patches → build is implicitly
documented by the Make targets; every correction to the decompile is a commented, traceable patch.
No guards, no approximations, no band-aids — any observable deviation from the original is by
definition a bug. **Code is the truth** — verify every claim against `DestructionDerby2/dd2h.exe` or a run.

## Pipeline — everything starts with `make` (the target chain IS the documentation; see `make help`)
`make decompile → assemble → patch → native/wasm → verify/verify-wasm` (+ `symbols`, `image`, `web`,
`shot`, `refcapture`). `make pipeline` runs the full from-binary chain.
- **Never hand-edit decompiled engine source** (`re_out/dd2_decomp.c` = pristine Ghidra output;
  `re_out/dd2.c` = mechanical assembly of it). Every engine correction is an ordered, exact-context
  **`patches/NNN-slug.diff`** with its rationale in the file header (that's where detailed notes belong,
  NOT here). `make patch` applies the series with -F0 --fuzz=0 — decompile drift fails loudly.
- Only hand-written code = the platform/runtime shim: `re_out/dd2_com.c` (DirectDraw→g_pixels), `dd2_win32.c`,
  `dd2_filio.c`, `dd2_stubs.c`, `dd2_input.c`, `dd2_runtime.c`, `tools/native_main.c`. Editing those is fine.
- `make decompile` runs Ghidra from `third_party/` (gitignored: ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC, jdk-21.0.11+10,
  proj `third_party/dd2_ghidra_proj`, PROGRAM=**dd2h.exe**); the project-DB setup scripts live in `tools/ghidra/`. Register-arg call sites are
  recovered by `tools/recover_regargs.py` (emits patch-stage material).

## Commands
- Native debug: `make native NATIVE=/tmp/dd2h_na`, run from `DestructionDerby2/` as
  `env -u DD2_NOSEGV DD2_LEVEL=N /tmp/dd2h_na`; symbolize with `addr2line -f -e`.
- Reference capture (Stage-2 bit-verify): `make refcapture` (WINEPREFIX defaults to the repo-local
  gitignored win32 prefix `.wine-dd2/`; needs xvfb; reads state via /proc/PID/mem, NOT gdb breakpoints).

## Status (3 sequential stages, each gates the next)
- Source: pure dd2h.exe decompile (`re_out/dd2.c` = dd2h Ghidra output, 640x480 rasterizers).
  Memory image: `re_out/extract_image.py DestructionDerby2/dd2h.exe` → `dd2_image.bin` (0x580400 bytes).
- **Stage 1 — crash-free: DONE.** `make verify` and `make verify-wasm` = **10/10 on both targets**,
  no guards — every fix is an asm-verified patch. Recurring Ghidra artifact classes (each patch header
  documents its instance): pointer scaling (int-typed byte tables indexed with byte offsets, e.g.
  DAT_00792bae), scattered locals (stack blocks split into separate C locals that gcc reorders —
  vertex arrays for the edge sorter, Setup_Sprite info blocks, camera vectors), dropped registers,
  paired 16-bit loads, unsigned/signed shifts+compares (dth_* span blitters need `sar` semantics),
  mid-function entries, wasm call_indirect signature normalization.
- **Stage 2 — bit-identical: ACTIVE.** Native↔wasm on the L2 demo is **fully bit-identical through
  engine frame 182 INCLUDING the 640x480 framebuffer (100.00%)** after the scattered-locals sweep
  (patches 495-565; 565 = the Calc_Object_Angles wrong-buffer fix, asm 0x4403d9). Only inherent
  host-pointer slots differ (whitelist: 0x74c47c, 0x74c6d8, cdb 0x75420e-0x7543a0, GTE regfile
  0x74c4e0-0x74c70c transients, rot_points/prim phase-noise 0x74f1c0-0x754220, unaligned particle
  callback slots). Compare tools: `DD2_STATECF=<frame> DD2_FRAMEDIR=<dir>` (wasm full-image dump
  keyed by engine frame 0x462ff0); native via gdb `break Draw_All if *(int*)0x462ff0 == N` + `dump
  binary memory`. NEXT: ours-vs-REFERENCE (ref L2@182 capture: fb 3.5%, trackstate 69% — needs
  tick-precise ref alignment + front-end-equivalent demo settings before byte-chasing; known
  faithfulness suspects: unsigned `>>0x10` paired-load reads, e.g. Car_1pt local_22, asm likely sar).
  Audio PCM staging [0x803160,0x816ff0) is zero in ours (DirectSound stubbed) — Stage 3.
- **Stage 3 — playable: after Stage 2.** Menus/track-select/race on keyboard+pad. Keyboard input wired
  (`re_out/dd2_input.c`); browser renders.

## Conventions
- Faithful reconstruction — no approximations/band-aids. Commit progress; verify BOTH targets after every change.
- `dd2_image.bin` (memory snapshot, loaded at 0x400000) must be present in `DestructionDerby2/` at run time.
- Wine gotchas: NEVER `pkill -f dd2h.exe` (kills own shell) → use `pkill -x`; win32 prefix = repo-local `.wine-dd2/`.
- Full pre-2026-07-01 investigation history is in git history + `/tmp/CLAUDE_full_backup.md`.
